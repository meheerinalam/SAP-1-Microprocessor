# SAP-1-Microprocessor-
This repository contains the Logisim Evolution implementation of a Simple-As-Possible (SAP-1) CPU. The SAP-1 is a foundational computer architecture used to teach the basic principles of CPU design.

This repository documents the design and implementation journey of a Simple-As-Possible (SAP-1) Microprocessor.

The project began with the schematic modeling of a basic CPU architecture in Logisim — including the general-purpose register, ALU, Program Counter, RAM, and Instruction Register — gradually evolving into a fully functional SAP-1 microprocessor.
Each stage of development, from manual control sequencing to automated microcoded execution, reflects a step toward understanding the fundamental working principles of computer architecture.

The repository is organized into branches:

1./sap1-foundation — contains the primary CPU design, built during the early development phase.

2./main — holds the latest and complete SAP-1 implementation with enhanced features and control automation.
