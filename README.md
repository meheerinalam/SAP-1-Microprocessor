# SAP-1-Microprocessor-
This repository contains the Logisim Evolution implementation of a Simple-As-Possible (SAP-1) CPU. The SAP-1 is a foundational computer architecture used to teach the basic principles of CPU design.
This branch contains the initial CPU design that served as the foundation for the later SAP-1 microprocessor.
The design includes the core functional units — General-Purpose Register, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and Program Counter — interconnected through an 8-bit bus architecture. These components were modeled and tested individually in Logisim, verifying data flow, control signal behavior, and arithmetic operations.
This early version represents the first functional prototype of the CPU, built to understand and validate the essential concepts of data transfer, storage, and execution before developing the full SAP-1 system.
